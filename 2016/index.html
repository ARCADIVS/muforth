<p>It&rsquo;s a bit embarrassing to have waited this long, but I have finally &ldquo;rescued&rdquo; the muFORTH blog posts from Blogger and moved them to their new home &ndash; here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to continue to write about developments in muFORTH as they happen, and also to troll through the git logs and pull out and post some of the juicier commit messages. They tell an interesting story, and often illuminate some aspect of the system.</p>
<p>Like muFORTH itself, this site is a work-in-progress, and is in a pretty raw state right now, but since my Blogger blog &ndash; the previous home of <a href="http://muforth.nimblemachines.com/">http://muforth.nimblemachines.com/</a> &ndash; has been untouched since 2010, I figured <em>some</em> kind of action was called for!</p>
<p>The rescued and archived Blogger posts are here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/2010/">2010</a></li>
<li><a href="/2009/">2009</a></li>
<li><a href="/2008/">2008</a></li>
</ul>
