<p>What is a &ldquo;convivial&rdquo; tool? What a strange term! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Illich">Ivan Illich</a> coined this usage in his book <a href="http://www.nimblemachines.com/tools-for-conviviality-book/"><em>Tools for conviviality</em></a> in which he says</p>
<blockquote><p>After many doubts, and against the advice of friends whom I respect, I have chosen &ldquo;convivial&rdquo; as a technical term to designate a modern society of responsibly limited tools.</p></blockquote>
<p>and then adds</p>
<blockquote><p>I am aware that in English &ldquo;convivial&rdquo; now seeks the company of tipsy jollyness, which is distinct from that indicated by the OED and opposite to the austere meaning of modern &ldquo;eutrapelia,&rdquo; which I intend. By applying the term &ldquo;convivial&rdquo; to tools rather than to people, I hope to forestall confusion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does that help? Probably not.</p>
<p>The idea is basically this: unless the people making things have <em>complete</em> control over the tools that they use, personal freedom and personal relatedness are impossible. A tool that has this malleable quality &ndash; and by extension, a society using those tools &ndash; he calls <em>convivial</em>.</p>
<p>I came across <a href="http://www.nimblemachines.com/tools-for-conviviality-book/">the book</a> quite by accident. In 1988 I quit, in disgust, my job at Microsoft, and went to Europe. When I returned to North America I stayed with a Canadian friend, at his parents&rsquo; house. His mom had a copy. (I wonder why &ndash; I should ask her.) I read it, enraptured.</p>
<p>It forever changed my life. Since then I have not been able to see technology except through its lens. This made me a dour critic of technology; it prevented me from getting excited about things that excite others; it even, perhaps, prevented me from having a &ldquo;career&rdquo; in technology. I was (and am!) deeply, and almost unconsciously, philosophically opposed to <em>most</em> aspects and artifacts of technology. I went apostate. I read lots of books, most of them written in 1973. Everything pointed to real food (ie, organic, grown from heirloom seed), to craft, to livable (walking) cities, to human scale. I rode my bicycle everywhere. I felt that technology was the enemy of everything I found myself caring about.</p>
<p>Some time in 1990 (I think it was) an odd conjunction occurred. I visited a family friend and talked about Forth &ndash; he wanted to make his own fuel-injection computer. Returning to Seattle, I read everything I could find about Forth. The Engineering library at the University of Washington has a lot: copies of the Caltech manual; the FORML (Forth modification lab) proceedings; copies of Forth Dimensions (the Forth Interest Group&rsquo;s ex-magazine).</p>
<p>I had known about Forth since I was sixteen; but I hadn&rsquo;t plumbed its depths until that week. I made up a packet of articles and hand-written notes and sent it off.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter I ran into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimpin">Trimpin</a>, a local artist. I had seen a performance of a work of his &ndash; <em>Circumference</em> &ndash; at Bumbershoot (a big arts festival in Seattle) a year or two before. This performance involved a roomful of percussion &ndash; drums, timpani, garbage cans &ndash; all played by &ldquo;robot hands&rdquo;. Each instrument had a drumstick poised over it, attached to a solenoid, which was attached via a homemade interface to Trimpin&rsquo;s computer. Using MIDI and MIDI sequencing software (Performer) he controlled this roomful of instruments. It was breathtaking.</p>
<p>His studio was in my neighborhood, and one day I met him on the street, getting an espresso &ndash; remember, this was Seattle!</p>
<p>We fell into a collaboration and I was able to realize two dreams: to use Forth, and to program the Motorola 6809, a processor I had been fascinated by since reading about it in Byte magazine in the late 1970s. I wrote a Forth development system, based on a terrible &ldquo;object-oriented&rdquo; Forth for the Macintosh. In a few days&rsquo; time I was able to write an assembler for the 6809, a Forth cross-compiler, and a simple &ldquo;chat&rdquo; protocol that allowed me to type commands on the host machine (the Mac) that were executed on the target (a small 6809-based embedded computer). All this was possible because of the simplicity and transparency of Forth.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this process tremendously. I felt empowered. I had never enjoyed programming in C this much. I went back to the library to figure out <em>why</em> Forth was so much fun, and discovered ... but&rsquo;s that another story. ;-) Someday I&rsquo;ll write about <span class="missing" title="tripping-over-lambda">tripping over lambda</span>.</p>
<p>Over the next ten years we collaborated on a series of projects. These were mostly handmade, idiosyncratic &ndash; and often musical &ndash; kinetic sculptures. Trimpin would collect modern industrial &ldquo;junk&rdquo; parts, and piece together a contraption; I would program it, always in Forth. I enjoyed aspects of this collaboration immensely. I worked in his studio &ndash; an appealing environment, much more Gepetto&rsquo;s workshop than high-tech office. I was combining technology and art. I was able to try out new (for me) ideas. I wrote a multitasker. I wrote code to generate and consume MIDI. I wrote an aleatoric music generator.</p>
<p>The largest program I wrote &ndash; which sequenced a forty-foot-tall sculpture consisting of four octaves of marimbas, xylophones, and wooden milk bottles, and composed simple musical sequences on the fly &ndash; consumed 6k of object code. (This is a permanent installation in the lobby of the Science Museum of Minnesota, in Saint Paul.)</p>
<p>Forth impressed me. It liberated and empowered me. It was a small tool &ndash; one that I could understand deeply and entirely. <em>I could make it entirely my own</em> and I have. I have written several Forths &ndash; two for the PC, and three for &ldquo;target&rdquo; machines: 6809, embedded 8086, and ARM.</p>
<p>Why is this interesting? Because I realize, looking back, that Forth is a <em>convivial tool</em>. I didn&rsquo;t know that going in; I wasn&rsquo;t sure, at the time, of the source of my sense of joyful liberation; but now I am sure that that is the reason.</p>
