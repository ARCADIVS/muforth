<h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>I wrote a Forth called muFORTH, to explore both implementation techniques (a simple native code compiler for the x86, tail recursion), and the idea of building a small kernel that can bootstrap itself by loading Forth code from source.</p>
<p>I started working on it in 2002; in 2005, after unsuccessfully trying to &ldquo;port&rdquo; the simple compiler to the PowerPC, so a friend with a G4 Mac could try the system, I rewrote the core to be an odd hybrid of C code and indirect-threaded Forth. Now it is (hopefully) completely portable. I know one person who is successfully using it on ARM hardware.</p>
<p>One of the primary reasons for writing muFORTH was to replace the very unportable Linux-specific Forth &ndash; dforth &ndash; that I had been using to do target compilation (for embedded control applications). I&rsquo;m <em>very</em> interested in writing target compilers hosted on muFORTH, and have partial support for <a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/mu/target/ARM/v5/">ARM7</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/mu/target/ARM/v7-m/">ARM Cortex-M</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/mu/target/AVR/">Atmel AVR</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/mu/target/MSP430/">TI MSP430</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/mu/target/HC08/">Freescale HCS08</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/mu/target/PIC18/">Microchip PIC18</a>. None of these compilers is complete, though.</p>
<h2 id="get-the-source"><a href="#get-the-source">Get the source</a></h2>
<p>The code is hosted at <a href="http://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/">Github</a>. It&rsquo;s super easy to build; just look at <a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/blob/master/BUILDING">BUILDING</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/blob/master/LICENSE">BSD licensed</a>, so do what you want with it! I&rsquo;d love to <a href="mailto:%6d%75%66%6f%72%74%68%2b%75%73%65%73%40%6e%69%6d%62%6c%65%6d%61%63%68%69%6e%65%73%2e%63%6f%6d?subject=%5bmuFORTH%5d%20muFORTH%3a%20a%20simple%20ITC%20Forth">hear about innovative or unusual uses</a> of muFORTH.</p>
<h2 id="documentation"><a href="#documentation">Documentation</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="/readme/">README</a> &ndash; though outdated in some ways &ndash; is a good introduction to why I wrote muFORTH and what I was trying to achieve. It describes the native-code compiler version of the system. That, and a few other things &ndash; notably create/does, the tokeniser, and the <em>lack</em> of tail-recursion in the threaded version &ndash; have changed since the <a href="/readme/">README</a> was written, but much of it is still true, applicable, and hopefully of interest.</p>
<p>The code &ndash; both the <a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/src/">C code that implements the Forth virtual machine</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/mu/">muFORTH code that does everything else</a> &ndash; is carefully and in some cases extensively commented. Right now your best source of documentation is the code! Luckily for you, there isn&rsquo;t that much, so reading it is actually possible. That&rsquo;s part of the point of muFORTH; I want it to be a <a href="/convivial-tool/">convivial tool</a>.</p>
<p>The key to the system is the Forth code that muFORTH reads when it first starts: <a href="https://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/blob/master/mu/startup.mu4">startup.mu4</a>. You&rsquo;ll learn a <em>lot</em> by reading this!</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The state of muFORTH&rsquo;s documentation will get much better! Especially if I <a href="mailto:%6d%75%66%6f%72%74%68%2b%64%6f%63%75%6d%65%6e%74%61%74%69%6f%6e%40%6e%69%6d%62%6c%65%6d%61%63%68%69%6e%65%73%2e%63%6f%6d?subject=%5bmuFORTH%5d%20muFORTH%3a%20a%20simple%20ITC%20Forth">hear feedback</a> about how terrible it is. ;-)</p>

<p>In March 2008 I gave a <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/859408">talk</a> about bootstrapping, muFORTH, and <a href="/convivial-tool/">convivial tool</a>s.</p>
<p>A warning: I wave my arms around a lot, and the audio isn&rsquo;t that great, but you might find it amusing.</p>
