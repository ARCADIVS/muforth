<p>I wrote a Forth called muFORTH, to explore some implementation techniques (a simple native code compiler for the x86, tail recursion), and the idea of building a small kernel, with just enough bits in it to bootstrap itself, by loading more Forth code from source.</p>
<p>I started working on it in 2002; in 2005, after unsuccessfully trying to &ldquo;port&rdquo; the simple compiler to the PowerPC, so a friend (<span class="missing" title="randy-thelen">Randy Thelen</span>) with a Mac could try the system, I rewrote the core to be an odd hybrid of C code and indirect-threaded Forth. Now it is (hopefully) completely portable.</p>
<p>The <a href="/muforth-readme/">muFORTH README</a> &ndash; though outdated in some ways &ndash; is a good introduction to why I wrote muFORTH and what I was trying to achieve. It describes the native-code compiler version of the system. That, and a few other things &ndash; notably create/does, the tokeniser, and the <em>lack</em> of tail-recursion in the threaded version &ndash; have changed since the <a href="/muforth-readme/">muFORTH README</a> was written, but much of it is still true, applicable, and hopefully of interest.</p>
<p>The code used to be in <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a>, but I am now using Git for everything. muFORTH is available via <a href="http://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master">Git</a>.</p>
<p>I kept a <a href="/muforth-diary/">muFORTH diary</a> for a while, but now the best annotated history is the Git commit comments, which you can browse, or read (from your cloned repo) using <em>git log</em> or <em>git log -p</em> (if you want to see diffs).</p>
<p>One of the primary reasons for writing muFORTH was to replace the very unportable Linux-specific Forth &ndash; dforth &ndash; that I had been using to do target compilation (for embedded control applications). I&rsquo;m <em>very</em> interested in writing target compilers, hosted on muFORTH, for the <a href="/arm-architecture/">ARM architecture</a> and <span class="missing" title="avr-architecture">AVR architecture</span>. I&rsquo;ve done much of the work already; both are in the master branch of the <span class="missing" title="git-repo">Git repo</span>; see <a href="http://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/mu/target/ARM/">target/ARM/</a> and <a href="http://github.com/nimblemachines/muforth/tree/master/mu/target/AVR/">target/AVR/</a>.</p>

<p>In March 2008 I gave a <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/859408">talk</a> about bootstrapping, muFORTH, and <a href="/convivial-tool/">convivial tool</a>s.</p>
<p>A warning: I wave my arms around a lot, and the audio isn&rsquo;t that great, but you might find it amusing.</p>
